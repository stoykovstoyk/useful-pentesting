# XSS Exploits

This directory contains examples and templates for demonstrating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and attacks. These scripts and templates are intended for educational and testing purposes only, to help security professionals understand and mitigate XSS risks.

## xss-template.svg

The `xss-template.svg` file demonstrates how SVG images can be used to exploit XSS vulnerabilities in web applications. SVG files, being XML-based, can include script elements that may be executed by a browser under certain conditions.

### Usage

To use the `xss-template.svg`:

1. **Inject the SVG File**: Try to inject the SVG file into a vulnerable web application that mishandles SVG input.
2. **Script Execution**: This SVG file contain JavaScript but can also include other scripting elements that will be executed by the browser if the SVG is rendered without proper sanitization.

### Ethical Considerations

- **Permission**: Ensure you have explicit permission to test the web applications you are targeting with these templates.
- **Legal Compliance**: Unauthorized testing or exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities is illegal and unethical. These examples are provided for educational purposes only.
